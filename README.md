# Programming Jokes
Instead of inspiring codes, I found some programming jokes.


This was a cool one I found on Pinterest. I thought this was super creative and if only bartenders in Auckland do this. I won't get the free drink though haha. 

```javascript
// Free drink for coders

var your_drink
var reverse=function(s) {
    return s.split("").reverse().join("");
}
var bartender = {
    str1: "ers",
    str2: reverse("rap"),
    str3: "amet",
    request:function(preference) {
        return preference+".Secret word:"
        +this.str2+this.str3+this.str1;
    }
};
bartender.request(your_drink)


```
The whole world right now.

```python
still_alive = True
while (still_alive):
WearMask()
Stay2mApart()
WashHands()
GetTested()


```
This is definitely an inspiring code.

```javascript
// Life Motto

if (sad() === true) {
sad().stop():
BeAwesome():
}
